## Project Overview üìë
Currently, the climate conditions in Indonesia are becoming difficult to predict. The main cause is believed to be due to the increase in global temperature, leading to climate change. This climate change has a negative impact on agricultural production. Unpredictable weather can potentially affect crop yields and the resources that need to be allocated. This impact is certainly not beneficial for PT. GGP, which heavily relies on crop yields to maintain their economic stability. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) is needed to generate climate information as a basis for decision-making so that plant resource management can be more efficient and the risk of crop failure can be minimized.

## About The Dataset üìÖ
The project uses Data from PT. GGP BMKG Weather station with 18 features and 4 years worth of data starting from early 2020 until the end of 2024. Before pipelining the data into model for training we need to first do feature selection as to only use the most relevant features for the model and not all 18 features. the features that will be used in this modeling are AVG_TEMP, RAINFALL, and AVG_WINDSPEED.

## Data Preprocessing üîó
Before being ready for analysis, data must be preprocessed first. Data preprocessing refers to the processes of cleaning, normalization, splitting, and segmentation of data to improve its quality and make it suitable for analysis.
**Cleaning**
In this section the data is inputed and then checked for any available missing value. if there are any missing value the model will use rolling mean to fill the value.
```
df = pd.read_excel('/content/cuaca_fix.xlsx', dtype={'Tanggal':str} , parse_dates=False)
df['Tanggal'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Tanggal'])
df.set_index('Tanggal', inplace=True)
columns = ['MAX_TEMP', 'MIN_TEMP', 'SUNLIGHT', 'AVG_HUM', 'MAX_WINDSPEED', 'WINDIR']
df = df.drop(columns = columns)

df.isna().sum()
df.fillna(round(df.rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean(), 2), inplace=True)
df.info()df.info()
```
**Splitting**
The next step is to split the data into 2 parts Training and Testing.
```
length = round(len(df) * 0.8)
train = df[:length]
test = df[length:]

print(f'Length of Training Data: {len(train)}')
print(f'Length of Test Data: {len(test)}')
```
**Normalization**
After the data is splitted. Using Minmax scaler the data is then normalized into ranges of 0-1 for faster training and eliminating biases.
```
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaler.fit(train)
train_scaled = scaler.transform(train)
test_scaled = scaler.transform(test)
```

**Segmentation**
Finally the data is grouped to ensure it meets the model's required format.
```
length = 7
batch_size = 32
generator = TimeseriesGenerator(train_scaled, train_scaled,
                                length=length,
                                batch_size=batch_size,
                                shuffle=False)

validation_generator = TimeseriesGenerator(test_scaled,test_scaled,
                                           length=length, batch_size=16, shuffle=False)
```


## Results ‚≠ê
The loss and accuracy metrics from the training and validation data show excellent results, indicating that the model is improving with each epoch. This consistent learning demonstrates the effectiveness of the training process and suggests that the model is successfully capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

Then using confusion matrix it is shown that the model is able to predict each class from test set accurately with only 1 missclassification.

## Conclusion üíæ
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in hand sign detection. The developed model can be a valuable tool to assist deaf people in communicating, learning, and performing various tasks more effectively.

## Suggestions üìé
- Experiment with more complex model architectures and other transfer learning models.
- Collect more data to improve model performance.
- Develop a real-time system to detect handsign using camera with bounding boxes.
- Develop a more complex logic to stitch together the letters to make a word.
